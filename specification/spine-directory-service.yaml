  title: Spine Directory Service API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access details of systems registered in the Spine Directory Service (SDS).
    
    You can:
    - get accredited system details

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    - search for organisations
    - search for people
    
    ### Accredited system records 
    Every system that connects to the Spine has one or more “Accredited System” (AS) records in SDS, identified by an Accredited System Identifier (ASID). 
    This ASID is unique to a system deployed in a specific organisation, so the same application deployed into three NHS organisations would typically be represented as three unique ASIDs. 
    
    ### MHS records and endpoints 
    Every GP Connect system also has one or more “MHS” records (or message handling server record), identified by Party Key and [Interaction ID](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-0-7-2/integration_interaction_ids.html). 
    MHS records of GP Connect provider systems contain the endpoint of the target practice, as defined by the [FHIR service root URL](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-0-7-2/development_fhir_api_guidance.html#service-root-url). 
    Please see [System topologies](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-0-7-2/integration_system_topologies.html) for more details on the allocation of ASIDs and Party Keys. 
    
    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.

    You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below). 
    
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in [private beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - the API is available in our sandbox and integration test environments
    - the API is available for production use (to use this API please contact niasupport@nhs.net)
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we'll give advance notice
    
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog.](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=all&tag=sds-fhir-api)
    
    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology 
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4. You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Endpoint` not `/endpoints`
    
    Errors handling in this API follows [NHS guidelines](https://nhsconnect.github.io/FHIR-SpineCore/resources_error_handling.html) and produces an [OperationOutcome](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Spine-OperationOutcome-1) FHIR resource response with appropriate HTTP code
    
    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network)
    
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Security and Authorisation 
    This API uses the Application-restricted pattern.  

    In this pattern, you authenticate your application by including an API key with each API request. The API key is unique to your application.

    For more details, including detailed technical integration instructions, see [Security and Authorisation - Application-restricted RESTful APIs - API key authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication) page within the NHS Digital Portal.

    ## Environments and testing 
    | Environment       | Base URL                                                       
    | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/spine-directory/FHIR/R4`         |
    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/spine-directory/FHIR/R4`             |
    
    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is open-access, so does not allow you to test authorisation
    
    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.
    
    ## Integration testing 
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing): 
    - is for formal integration testing.
    - includes application authentication
    
    ## Data
    This API does not have a standard test data pack as it will be dependant on the service you are trying to access, for more details see [Spine Services and Interaction IDs](https://nhsconnect.github.io/FHIR-SpineCore/security_interaction_ids.html) and [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    Details of how system-to-system authorisation is managed through the use of Interaction IDs for Services.

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.
    This API is not yet available for onboarding.
